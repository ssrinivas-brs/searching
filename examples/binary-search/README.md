## Binary Search

The binarySearch function performs a binary search on a sorted array **arr** to find the index of the target element. It compares the target with the middle element of the current search range and narrows the search range to the left or right half accordingly. It continues until the target is found, returning its index, or returns **-1** if the target is **not present** in the array.
