## Linear Search

The linearSearch function searches for the index of the target element in the arr array using the linear search algorithm. It iterates through the array one element at a time, comparing each element with the target. If the target is found, the function returns the index of the first occurrence. If the target is not found in the array, the function returns -1.

Linear search is simple but less efficient compared to other search algorithms for large arrays.
