## Interpolation Search

The interpolationSearch function searches for the index of the target element in a sorted array array using the interpolation search algorithm. It estimates the probable position of the target based on its value and the range of elements in the array.

The function returns the index of the target if found, or **-1** if the target is not present in the array. Interpolation search is particularly useful for uniformly distributed and sorted data.
